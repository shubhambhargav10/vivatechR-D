This is a simple task management web application built using React. It allows users to add, update, delete tasks, move tasks between lists, and export the entire list to Excel.


## Responsiveness

The Task Management App is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes. The following considerations have been made:

- **Large Screens:**
  - The app provides an optimal experience on large screens, utilizing the available space efficiently.

- **Medium Screens:**
  - On medium-sized screens, such as tablets, the app adjusts its layout to maintain a user-friendly interface.

- **Small Screens:**
  - The app is fully responsive on small screens, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile devices.
